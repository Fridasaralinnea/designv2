Min me-sida i kursen design
=========================


[FIGURE src="image/me.jpeg?w=500" class="right" caption="Bild p√• mig"]

Hello and welcome to my me-page. My name is Frida Larsson and I'm 26 years old. I'm born and raised in a small town called Falkenberg, on the west-coast of Sweden. For the last two and a half years I've been mostly traveling or working abroad and at the moment I'm in Sri Lanka.

I got introduced to programming about a year ago and i really liked it. After taking some small online courses I decided I wanted to learn more. I looked up some different couses and realized i could keep on traveling and surfing while studying by distance. I'm super exited about learning more and I look forward to the next two years.
